# Suppress cache-poisoning warning for publish workflow
# Rationale: Low-confidence finding with multiple mitigations in place:
# - Uses --frozen-lockfile to ensure dependencies match lock file
# - Uses --provenance for cryptographic attestation
# - Restricted permissions (contents: read, id-token: write)
# - Only runs on tagged releases
# - Publishing doesn't happen frequently, so cache benefit is minimal

rules:
  cache-poisoning:
    ignore:
      - "publish.yml"
